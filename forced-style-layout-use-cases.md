Here is a running list of use-cases for forced style and layout:

* Detecting whether an element is rendered/visible (not just in the viewport, but visible)
* Positioning an element relative to another one elsewhere in the DOM (e.g. for a tooltip)
* Sizing and positioning a hero animation
* Setting up an animation of a container into a dynamic layout state (e.g. show-hide animations of an accordion; animating an element to size to new content)
* Programmatically setting the scroll offset of an element
* Choosing an ad according to available space
* Iframes that size to fit their content
* Determining how much text can fit on a line (for truncation or multi-line input)
* Sidebar that scrolls with the main content
* Detecting landscape vs portrait intrinsic content fitting
* Avoiding overlap with existing elements when adding a floating element
* Applying focus to an element programmatically
* Feature detection
* Fraud detection
* Forcing a state snapshop before starting an animation
* Checking for accessibility compliance
* Check if a theme was loaded
* Detecting high-contrast mode
